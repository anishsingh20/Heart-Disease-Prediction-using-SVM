## Prediction of heart disease

### Aim of analysis

In the following document, I will be using SVM classification techinque to predict heart disease (angiographic disease status). From a set of 14 variables, the most important to predict heart failure are whether or not there is a reversable defect in Thalassemia followed by whether or not there is an occurrence of asymptomatic chest pain.
